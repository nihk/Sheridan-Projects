# SheridanProjects
This repo holds a few of the final projects I did as a first/second year student at Sheridan. 
\<showoff\>Each received the highest possible mark within their respective class\</showoff\>

**DatabaseProject** is the final assignment for the database class I took in which
we used MS SQL Server. The [Project_Instructions.doc](https://github.com/nihk/SheridanProjects/blob/master/DatabaseProject/Project_Instructions.doc) file outlined the steps necessary to complete it.
I have included the most interesting aspects of the project in this repo, namely the EER Diagram and 
SQL DDL/DML.

**Jbooks** is the final assignment for the JavaEE class I took in which we used Servlets, JSP (EL, JSTL), 
and the MVC design pattern. The app validates a user's login information and enables them to add to, search,
and show all records from a MySQL database using the JDBC driver.

**NetworkingVLANs** is the final assignment for the Networking class I took in which we created a network
topology, defined ip addresses based on a given subnet mask, and created VLANs through switch and router.

**PasswordManager** is a Java program in which one can manage a file that contains a user's usernames and password.
It uses the Swing toolkit to create new usernames/passwords and encrypt/decrypt them. 
This project was written for my Java 2 class to reflect an understanding of using a GUI in Java as
well as File handling.

**Project-WebProg** is the final project of my web programming class which used JavaScript, PHP, and MySQL.
This website is a mock student-registration form in which a student can enrol in a program and choose courses
repsective to that module. It stores these values in a MySQL database.
