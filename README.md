# SheridanProjects
This repo holds a few of the final projects I did as a first year student at Sheridan. 
\<showoff\>Each received the highest possible mark within their respective class\</showoff\>

**PasswordManager** is a Java program in which one can manage a file that contains a user's usernames and password.
It uses the Swing toolkit to create new usernames/passwords and encrypt/decrypt them. 
This project was written for my Java 2 class to reflect an understanding of using a GUI in Java as
well as File handling.

**Project-WebProg** is the final project of my web programming class which used JavaScript, PHP, and MySQL.
This website is a mock student-registration form in which a student can enrol in a program and choose courses
repsective to that module. It stores these values in a MySQL database.
